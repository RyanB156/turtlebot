Purpose - Provide a demonstration to high school students to show that
  we do fun projects at Poly.

Idea - Simple. Have one robot move around the room while another one follows.
  Then simulate an attack that severs the communication between the robots.
  This makes the one following act erratically

Implementation - 
  -Global-
  New package for the python scripts (demo)
  -Parent-
  New publisher that will send data to the child (what format?)
  Listen to cmd_vel for the parent to send to the child (possibly)

  -Child-
  Listen for information which controls its movement
  New publisher to send commands on cmd_vel
  End communication -> move randomly and crash
