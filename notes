Issues setting up turtlebot:
	Finding an install with ROS and can connect to Poly Secure: ubiquity
	Wrong time on RPi: sync with time server
	Network configuration: .bashrc sourced /etc/ubiquity/env.sh which reset 
        the value of ROS_MASTER_URI. Move this before export statements 
        or delete
	Cannot find AF_INET ADDR: Set IP and hostname in /etc/hosts

If the turtlebot's IP address changes, be sure to edit the turtlebot's .bashrc
    file to set ROS_IP to the new IP and edit /etc/hosts on all machines
